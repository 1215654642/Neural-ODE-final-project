#Applying Neural ODE as time-series model
## Scientific Computing Individual Research Project
This library provides three experiments for Neural ODE and all results related in report are generated by these codes. All used visualization results are listed in `result` folder and all data are listed in `data` folder.
## Installation
Firstly, downloading required libraries
```Python
pip install torchdyn
```
```Python
pip install torchdiffeq
```
```Python
pip install pytorch-lightning
```
## Code structure
Firstly, standard and basic Neural ODE model is defined in `Neural_ODE.py` and `ODE_solver.py` defines three black-box ODE solvers. Then `MNIST.py` contains codes for supervised learning of Neural ODE model, `ODE-LSTM.py` contains codes for applying ODE-LSTM model as time-series model using climate data as input. Finally, `latent.py` contains codes for Latent ODE using generative random spirals data as input.
## Examples
1. In first experiment, run `MNIST.py` and corresponding result would be provided. The type of applied black-box solver could be changed inside this file.
